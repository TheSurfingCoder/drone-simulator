âœ… Prioritized Roadmap (with notes)
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1 â€“ Core Usability + Launch Readiness


Set up a public repo + write a good README
â€£ Include a short video/GIF demo, project purpose, stack, and usage instructions.




set up API key rate limiting in Cesium account

Allow for current location

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 â€“ Mission Planning System
Add MissionPlanner UI (Create / Import / Export buttons)
â€£ This becomes your appâ€™s core CTA. Clean and approachable.

Export flight plans (as GeoJSON or custom JSON)
â€£ Critical for saving, sharing, or flying later.

Import mission support
â€£ Rehydrate waypoints and view them instantly.

Change drone icon
â€£ Improves visual identity and demo quality. Find or design a realistic top-down drone SVG.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 â€“ Advanced Interaction
Search by lat/lng or address to jump to location
â€£ Improves utility for real pilots. Use a geocoding API like Mapbox or OpenCage.

Waypoint metadata UI (display lat/lng/alt at marker)
â€£ Hover/click a point to see full info.

Support vertical altitude adjustments (drag handle or manual input)
â€£ Big leap forward. Requires 3D interaction UI â€” not trivial, but awesome.

Clicking the air for altitude estimation
â€£ Experimental UX. If Cesium can raycast to atmosphere or just use camera pitch + mouse, this could work. But may require a fallback.

Flatten buttons to look like UI on terrain (billboarding)
â€£ Low priority polish. Cool, but can do after core features.
